Suppose you are building a web application and you dont want to put all your code in a single controller and a single view.So your application will have multiple views and multiple controllers that binds your data.

Routing based on URL.
routing engine captures the request.
Routing rules render a response.

Routing with angular:
depends on another module: angular-route.js . We can use component which is ng-route.  configure rules into $routeProvider. in this you need to describe all the urls and tell the routing engine how to deal with that particular urls. 
This module is called ng-route.	$routeProvider has an APi which tells you how the url look like and what to do with that url.

for each url , you can specify a template url i.e the html which angular has to find and load up for that url and the corresponding controller.

so our default html file will now become what is commonly called as layout view or a show view.

now there will be a space in the body of the default page where routing engine can load a certain template. we will tell the routing engine where to load these templates using the ng-view.
